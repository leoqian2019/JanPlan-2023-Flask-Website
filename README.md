# JanPlan-2023-Flask-Website
This is a website built via Flask for the purpose of textbook exchange. After registration, student need to enter textbook they have and textbook they want so that the system can pair students up for exchange.

The project is separated into front end and back end which the front end uses Bootstrap template and the backend is handled by Flask in python.

To install the dependencies, run 
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
on the project root directory, depending on your pip version, you may need to use
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I used python 3.9 to run the project, but any other python 3 version should be fine.

## Start the server
After installing the dependencies, run main.py and the server should automatically start on 127.0.0.1:5000
